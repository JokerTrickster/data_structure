# data_structure
Implement data structures in go language (queue, stack, linked list)

# Project Introduction:
- Description: This repository aims to implement linked list, queue, and stack data structures in Golang.
- Goal: The goal of this project is to provide clear implementations of these fundamental data structures along with their common operations.

# Features:
- Linked List: Supports insertion, deletion, and searching operations.
- Queue: Provides enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
- Stack: Supports push, pop, and peek operations.

# Usage:
- Examples: Below are examples demonstrating how to use each data structure in your Go code.
- Installation: To use these data structures, simply import the package into your Go code.

# Problem Statements:
### Linked List:
1. Index Insertion: Implements insertion of an element at that index into a linked list.  
2. Insertion: Implements additional insertion at the end of a linked list.  
3. Index Delete: Deletes the value at that index from the linked list.  
4. Index Search: Implements searching for an element at its index in a linked list.  

--------------- 
### Stack:
1. IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.   
2. Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.  
3. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.  
4. Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.  
5. Len: Returns the number of elements in the stack.
